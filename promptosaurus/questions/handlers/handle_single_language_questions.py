"""Handler for single-language repository question flow.

This module defines the HandleSingleLanguageQuestions class which
manages the question flow for single-language repositories. It
prompts users to select a primary language and then asks all
language-specific questions from the configured pipeline.

The handler coordinates:
1. Language selection from supported languages
2. Loading of core questions for the selected language
3. Presentation of each question to gather user preferences
4. Compilation of responses into a configuration dictionary
