    """Question for determining repository structure type.

    This question helps configure how language conventions are applied
    based on whether the project uses a single language, multi-language
    monorepo, or mixed collocation structure. The answer affects which
    convention files are included in the prompts and how language-specific
    settings are applied across the codebase.

    Repository structure determines:
    - Which convention files are loaded (single vs multiple language configs)
    - How folder-specific questions are handled
    - Whether language settings apply globally or per-folder

        question_text: The question presented to the user
        explanation: Detailed explanation of repository types
        options: Available repository types
