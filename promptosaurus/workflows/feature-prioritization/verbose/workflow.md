## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Feature Discovery and Collection

#### Step 1: Aggregate Feature Requests
**Sources to Consider:**
- Customer feature requests
- Support ticket patterns
- Sales team feedback (win/loss analysis)
- User research findings
- Competitive analysis gaps
- Technical debt items
- Compliance requirements
- Internal stakeholder requests

**Documentation Standards:**
- Clear problem statement
- User segment affected
- Current workarounds
- Success criteria
- Initial effort estimate

#### Step 2: Feature Definition and Refinement
**For Each Feature:**
- Write clear problem statement
- Define target user segment
- Document expected outcomes
- List acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies
- Note assumptions and risks

**Feature Card Template:**
```
Feature: Advanced Search Filters
Problem: Users cannot find specific content efficiently
User Segment: Power users (15% of base)
Current State: Basic keyword search only
Desired State: Multi-faceted search with filters
Success Metric: Search-to-action time reduced by 40%
```

#### Step 3: Initial Categorization
**Categories:**
- **User Experience:** Direct user-facing improvements
- **Revenue Growth:** Features that drive new revenue
- **Retention:** Features that reduce churn
- **Platform:** Infrastructure and technical capabilities
- **Compliance:** Regulatory or security requirements
- **Innovation:** Experimental or differentiating features

### Phase 2: Scoring and Evaluation

#### Step 4: Apply RICE Framework
**Detailed RICE Scoring:**

**Reach (per quarter):**
- Count unique users/customers affected
- Consider adoption rate realistically
- Account for gradual rollout
- Example: 10,000 users × 80% adoption = 8,000

**Impact Scale:**
- 3 = Massive (game-changing for users)
- 2 = High (significant improvement)
- 1 = Medium (noticeable enhancement)
- 0.5 = Low (minor improvement)
- 0.25 = Minimal (barely noticeable)

**Confidence Percentage:**
- 100% = High (data-validated, well-understood)
- 80% = Medium-High (strong indicators)
- 60% = Medium (reasonable assumptions)
- 50% = Low (significant unknowns)
- Below 50% = Not ready for prioritization

**Effort (person-months):**
- Include all disciplines (engineering, design, QA)
- Add buffer for unknowns (20-30%)
- Consider maintenance burden
- Account for dependencies

**Calculation:**
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
Reach: 5,000 users
Impact: 2 (High)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 3 person-months
Score = (5,000 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 2,667
```

#### Step 5: Additional Scoring Dimensions
**Strategic Alignment Score (1-5):**
- 5 = Critical to strategy
- 4 = Strongly supports strategy
- 3 = Aligns with strategy
- 2 = Neutral to strategy
- 1 = Diverges from strategy

**Technical Risk Score (1-5):**
- 1 = Proven approach, low risk
- 2 = Minor uncertainties
- 3 = Moderate complexity
- 4 = Significant unknowns
- 5 = High risk, new technology

**Market Timing Score (1-5):**
- 5 = Critical window closing
- 4 = Strong first-mover advantage
- 3 = Good market timing
- 2 = No urgency
- 1 = Too early for market

#### Step 6: Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Revenue Impact:**
- New revenue potential
- Upsell/cross-sell opportunities
- Churn reduction value
- Efficiency gains

**Cost Considerations:**
- Development costs
- Infrastructure costs
- Maintenance burden
- Opportunity cost
- Training and support costs

### Phase 3: Dependencies and Constraints

#### Step 7: Map Technical Dependencies

- Consider infrastructure needs
- Plan for technical debt

**Dependency Matrix:**
```
Feature A → requires → Feature B
Feature B → requires → Platform Update X
Feature C → blocks → Feature D
```

#### Step 8: Resource Constraint Analysis
**Team Capacity:**
- Available developer hours
- Designer bandwidth
- QA capacity
- DevOps requirements

**Skill Requirements:**
- Specialized expertise needed
- Training requirements
- Vendor dependencies
- Consultant needs

#### Step 9: Risk Assessment
**Risk Categories:**
