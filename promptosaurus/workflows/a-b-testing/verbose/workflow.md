# A/B Testing Workflow - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

A/B testing (split testing) is a scientific method for comparing two or more versions of a product experience to determine which performs better. This workflow provides a systematic approach to hypothesis formation, experiment design, execution, analysis, and decision-making. Effective A/B testing enables data-driven product development, reduces risk, and maximizes the impact of product changes.

## Prerequisites

### Team and Stakeholders
- Product managers
- Data scientists/analysts
- UX designers
- Engineers (frontend/backend)
- QA team
- Marketing team (for growth experiments)
- Business stakeholders

### Technical Infrastructure
- Experimentation platform (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split.io)
- Analytics infrastructure (see analytics-setup-workflow)
- Feature flag system
- Statistical analysis tools (R, Python, or built-in platform tools)
- Sample size calculators
- Reporting dashboards

### Required Preparations
- Baseline metrics established
- Success metrics defined
- Statistical power requirements understood
- Testing culture established
- Decision framework agreed upon

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Hypothesis Development

#### Step 1: Identify Opportunity
**Opportunity Sources:**
- User research insights
- Analytics data patterns
- Customer feedback
- Competitive analysis
- Conversion funnel drop-offs
- Support ticket themes

**Opportunity Assessment:**
```
Opportunity: High cart abandonment rate (68%)
Current State: Multi-page checkout process
Potential: Industry average is 45% abandonment
Hypothesis Area: Simplifying checkout flow
Expected Impact: 10-15% reduction in abandonment
```

#### Step 2: Form Hypothesis
**Hypothesis Structure:**
```
If we [make this change]
For [this user segment]
Then we will see [this outcome]
Because [underlying reason]
```

**Example Hypotheses:**
```
Primary Hypothesis:
If we change from a 3-step to single-page checkout
For all users
Then we will see a 15% increase in checkout completion
Because users will have less opportunity to abandon

Secondary Hypothesis:
If we add progress indicators to the checkout
For mobile users
Then we will see a 10% increase in completion
Because users will understand how much is left
```

#### Step 3: Define Success Metrics
**Primary Metrics:**
- The main metric that determines success
- Directly tied to hypothesis
- Must be measurable and significant

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Supporting indicators
- Help explain primary metric changes
- Provide additional context

**Guardrail Metrics:**
- Metrics that shouldn't get worse
- Protect against unintended consequences
- Examples: revenue, user satisfaction, page load time

**Metric Definition Example:**
```yaml
primary_metric:
  name: "Checkout Completion Rate"
  definition: "Completed purchases / Checkout starts"
  current_value: 0.32
  target_improvement: 0.15
  minimum_detectable_effect: 0.05

secondary_metrics:
  - name: "Average Order Value"
    definition: "Total revenue / Number of orders"
  - name: "Time to Complete Checkout"
    definition: "Median seconds from start to completion"

guardrail_metrics:
  - name: "Cart Abandonment Rate"
    threshold: "Should not increase"
  - name: "Payment Errors"
    threshold: "Should not exceed 2%"
```

### Phase 2: Experiment Design

#### Step 4: Calculate Sample Size
**Statistical Parameters:**
- **Significance Level (α):** Typically 0.05 (5% false positive rate)
- **Power (1-β):** Typically 0.80 (80% chance of detecting effect)
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE):** Smallest meaningful change
- **Baseline Conversion Rate:** Current metric value

**Sample Size Formula:**
```python
import math
from scipy import stats

def calculate_sample_size(baseline_rate, mde, alpha=0.05, power=0.8):
    """
    Calculate required sample size per variant
    """
    # Effect size
    effect_size = mde / math.sqrt(baseline_rate * (1 - baseline_rate))
    
    # Z-scores
    z_alpha = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)
    z_power = stats.norm.ppf(power)
    
    # Sample size per variant
    n = 2 * ((z_alpha + z_power) / effect_size) ** 2
    
    return math.ceil(n)

# Example calculation
baseline = 0.32  # 32% conversion rate
mde = 0.05       # 5% absolute increase
required_sample = calculate_sample_size(baseline, mde)
print(f"Required sample per variant: {required_sample}")
```

**Duration Estimation:**
```
Daily Traffic: 10,000 visitors
Required Sample: 3,000 per variant (6,000 total)
Estimated Duration: 6,000 / 10,000 = 0.6 days minimum
Recommended Duration: 7 days (full week cycle)
```

#### Step 5: Design Variations
**Variation Principles:**
- Change one variable at a time (for clarity)
- Make changes noticeable enough to impact behavior
- Ensure variations are technically feasible
- Consider edge cases and error states

**Variation Documentation:**
```markdown
## Control (A)
- Current 3-step checkout
- Shipping → Payment → Review
- Mobile: Same as desktop

## Variant (B)
- Single-page checkout
- All fields visible
- Progressive disclosure for sections
- Mobile: Accordion layout

## Key Differences
- Number of page loads: 3 vs 1
- Field visibility: Progressive vs All
- Progress indication: Steps vs Sections
```

#### Step 6: Determine Test Parameters
**Traffic Allocation:**
```yaml
test_name: "Checkout Optimization v1"
traffic_split:
  control: 50%
  variant: 50%
  
eligibility_criteria:
  - user_type: "all"
  - device: ["desktop", "mobile", "tablet"]
  - geography: "US only"  # Start with single market
  - excluded_users: ["employees", "beta_testers"]

randomization:
  method: "deterministic"  # Consistent experience per user
  seed: "user_id"
  
test_duration:
  minimum: 7 days
  maximum: 30 days
  early_stop_criteria: "harm only"  # Only stop if causing harm
```

### Phase 3: Implementation

#### Step 7: Technical Setup
**Feature Flag Implementation:**
```javascript
// Feature flag setup
const experimentConfig = {
  name: 'checkout_optimization_v1',
  variants: {
    control: {
      weight: 50,
      config: {
        checkoutType: 'multi_step',
        showProgress: true,
        stepsCount: 3
      }
    },
    treatment: {
      weight: 50,
      config: {
        checkoutType: 'single_page',
        showProgress: false,
        useAccordion: true
      }
    }
  }
};

// Assignment logic
function getVariant(userId) {
  // Check if user already assigned
  const existingAssignment = getStoredAssignment(userId);
  if (existingAssignment) {
    return existingAssignment;
  }
  
  // Random assignment based on user ID hash
  const hash = hashUserId(userId);
  const variant = hash % 100 < 50 ? 'control' : 'treatment';
  
  // Store assignment
  storeAssignment(userId, variant);
  
  // Track exposure
  analytics.track('Experiment Exposed', {
    experiment_name: 'checkout_optimization_v1',
    variant: variant,
    user_id: userId
  });
  
  return variant;
}
```

**Tracking Implementation:**
```javascript
// Track experiment metrics
function trackCheckoutMetrics(variant) {
  // Track funnel events
  analytics.track('Checkout Started', {
    experiment: 'checkout_optimization_v1',
    variant: variant,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  // Track micro-conversions
  analytics.track('Checkout Step Completed', {
    experiment: 'checkout_optimization_v1',
    variant: variant,
    step_name: currentStep,
    time_on_step: timeSpent
  });
  
  // Track completion
  analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {
    experiment: 'checkout_optimization_v1',
    variant: variant,
    order_value: orderTotal,
    items_count: itemCount
  });
}
```

#### Step 8: Quality Assurance
**QA Checklist:**
- [ ] Both variations render correctly
- [ ] Random assignment works properly
- [ ] Users stay in same variant (sticky sessions)
- [ ] Tracking fires for all events
- [ ] Edge cases handled (errors, timeouts)
- [ ] Mobile experience tested
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

**Testing Procedures:**
```bash
# Force variant for testing
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/checkout" \
  -H "X-Force-Variant: treatment" \
  -H "User-Id: test_user_123"

# Verify assignment distribution
SELECT 
  variant,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER() as percentage
FROM experiment_assignments
WHERE experiment_name = 'checkout_optimization_v1'
GROUP BY variant;
```

#### Step 9: Launch Experiment
**Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards ready
- [ ] Support team briefed
- [ ] Rollback plan confirmed
- [ ] Success criteria documented

**Gradual Rollout:**
```yaml
rollout_plan:
  day_1:
    traffic: 10%
    duration: 4 hours
    checkpoint: "Verify no errors"
    
  day_2:
    traffic: 25%
    duration: 24 hours
    checkpoint: "Check early metrics"
    
  day_3_onwards:
    traffic: 50%
    duration: "Until significance"
    checkpoint: "Daily monitoring"
```

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Analysis

#### Step 10: Monitor Experiment Health
**Real-time Monitoring:**
```sql
-- Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) check
WITH variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as actual_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) OVER() as actual_percentage
  FROM experiment_exposures
  WHERE experiment_name = 'checkout_optimization_v1'
    AND exposure_date >= CURRENT_DATE
  GROUP BY variant
)
SELECT 
  variant,
  actual_count,
  actual_percentage,
  50.0 as expected_percentage,
  ABS(actual_percentage - 50.0) as deviation
FROM variant_counts;

-- Check for data quality issues
SELECT 
  DATE(exposure_time) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
  COUNT(*) as total_exposures,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN variant IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_variants
FROM experiment_exposures
WHERE experiment_name = 'checkout_optimization_v1'
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Alert Configuration:**
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "SRM Detection"
    condition: "variant_split_deviation > 2%"
    action: "Pause experiment and investigate"
    
  - name: "Metric Degradation"
    condition: "conversion_rate_drop > 10%"
    action: "Review with team, consider stopping"
    
  - name: "Technical Errors"
    condition: "error_rate > 5%"
    action: "Immediate rollback"
```

#### Step 11: Statistical Analysis
**Interim Analysis:**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

def analyze_experiment(control_data, treatment_data):
    """
    Perform statistical analysis on experiment results
    """
    # Calculate conversion rates
    control_rate = control_data['conversions'] / control_data['visitors']
    treatment_rate = treatment_data['conversions'] / treatment_data['visitors']
    
    # Calculate lift
    absolute_lift = treatment_rate - control_rate
    relative_lift = absolute_lift / control_rate
    
    # Perform chi-square test
    contingency_table = np.array([
        [control_data['conversions'], control_data['visitors'] - control_data['conversions']],
        [treatment_data['conversions'], treatment_data['visitors'] - treatment_data['conversions']]
    ])
    chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)
    
    # Calculate confidence interval
    se_diff = np.sqrt(
        control_rate * (1 - control_rate) / control_data['visitors'] +
        treatment_rate * (1 - treatment_rate) / treatment_data['visitors']
    )
    ci_lower = absolute_lift - 1.96 * se_diff
    ci_upper = absolute_lift + 1.96 * se_diff
    
    return {
        'control_rate': control_rate,
        'treatment_rate': treatment_rate,
        'absolute_lift': absolute_lift,
        'relative_lift': relative_lift,
        'p_value': p_value,
        'confidence_interval': (ci_lower, ci_upper),
        'significant': p_value < 0.05
    }
```

**Sequential Testing (Optional):**
```python
# Use sequential testing to allow for early stopping
# while maintaining statistical validity

from statsmodels.stats.sequential import Sequential

# Configure sequential test
sequential_test = Sequential(
    alpha=0.05,  # Type I error rate
    beta=0.20,   # Type II error rate
    delta=0.05,  # Minimum detectable effect
    method='obrien_fleming'  # Spending function
)

# Check at each interim analysis
for day in range(1, max_days):
    result = sequential_test.test(
        successes_control=daily_conversions_control[day],
        trials_control=daily_visitors_control[day],
        successes_treatment=daily_conversions_treatment[day],
        trials_treatment=daily_visitors_treatment[day]
    )
    
    if result == 'reject':
        print(f"Significant result on day {day}")
        break
    elif result == 'accept':
        print(f"No effect detected, stop test on day {day}")
        break
```

#### Step 12: Segment Analysis
**Segmentation Dimensions:**
```sql
-- Analyze by user segment
SELECT 
  u.user_segment,
  e.variant,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as users,
  SUM(c.converted) as conversions,
  SUM(c.converted) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as conversion_rate
FROM experiment_exposures e
JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN conversions c ON e.user_id = c.user_id 
  AND c.timestamp >= e.exposure_time
WHERE e.experiment_name = 'checkout_optimization_v1'
GROUP BY u.user_segment, e.variant
ORDER BY u.user_segment, e.variant;

-- Analyze by device type
SELECT 
  device_type,
  variant,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users,
  AVG(conversion_rate) as avg_conversion_rate,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY session_duration) as median_duration
FROM experiment_metrics
WHERE experiment_name = 'checkout_optimization_v1'
GROUP BY device_type, variant;
```

### Phase 5: Decision and Rollout

#### Step 13: Make Decision
**Decision Framework:**
```
Statistical Significance: p < 0.05
Practical Significance: Lift > MDE
Guardrails: All passing
Segment Analysis: No concerning segments
Qualitative Feedback: Positive or neutral

Decision Matrix:
- Ship: All criteria met
- Iterate: Some criteria met, fixable issues
- Abandon: Criteria not met or negative impact
```

**Decision Documentation:**
```markdown
## Experiment: Checkout Optimization v1

### Results Summary
- **Duration:** 14 days
- **Sample Size:** 12,000 users (6,000 per variant)
- **Primary Metric:** Checkout completion rate
  - Control: 32.0%
  - Treatment: 36.5%
  - Relative Lift: +14.1%
  - P-value: 0.002
  - 95% CI: [2.1%, 6.9%]

### Secondary Metrics
- Average Order Value: No significant change
- Time to Complete: -45 seconds (significant)
- Cart Abandonment: -4.5pp (significant)

### Guardrails
- Payment Errors: 1.8% (within threshold)
- Page Load Time: +200ms (acceptable)

### Segment Analysis
- Mobile: +18% lift (stronger effect)
- Desktop: +11% lift
- New Users: +20% lift
- Returning Users: +8% lift

### Decision: SHIP TO 100%

### Rationale
- Statistically and practically significant
- Positive across all segments
- Guardrails maintained
- Especially beneficial for mobile users
```

#### Step 14: Plan Rollout
**Rollout Strategy:**
```yaml
rollout_strategy:
  phase_1:
    name: "Gradual Rollout"
    week_1: 60%
    week_2: 80%
    week_3: 100%
    monitoring: "Daily dashboards"
    
  phase_2:
    name: "Feature Cleanup"
    remove_control: "After 30 days"
    archive_data: "After 90 days"
    
  communication:
    internal:
      - engineering: "Technical implementation"
      - support: "User guide updates"
      - sales: "Feature talking points"
    external:
      - users: "In-app notification"
      - blog: "Improvement announcement"
```

#### Step 15: Post-Experiment Analysis
**Learning Documentation:**
```markdown
## Experiment Learnings

### What Worked
- Single-page checkout reduced cognitive load
- Mobile users especially benefited
- Progressive disclosure maintained clarity

### What Didn't Work
- Some users confused by all fields visible
- Slight increase in page load time

### Surprises
- New users adapted better than expected
- Time savings larger than anticipated

### Follow-up Experiments
1. Test progress indicators in single-page
2. Optimize load time with lazy loading
3. Test autofill optimizations

### Process Improvements
- Need better mobile testing setup
- Should track more micro-conversions
- Consider longer test duration for seasonality
```

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Variate Testing (MVT)
**When to Use:**
- Testing multiple elements simultaneously
- Understanding interaction effects
- Sufficient traffic volume

**Design Considerations:**
```
Factors:
  A: Button Color (Red, Blue)
  B: Button Text ("Buy Now", "Add to Cart")
  C: Button Position (Top, Bottom)

Full Factorial: 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 variants
Required Sample: 8 × base_sample_size
```

### Bandit Algorithms
**Multi-Armed Bandits:**
- Dynamically allocate traffic to winning variant
- Balance exploration and exploitation
- Useful for continuous optimization

```python
class ThompsonSampling:
    def __init__(self, n_variants):
        self.successes = np.zeros(n_variants)
        self.failures = np.zeros(n_variants)
    
    def select_variant(self):
        # Sample from beta distributions
        samples = [
            np.random.beta(self.successes[i] + 1, self.failures[i] + 1)
            for i in range(len(self.successes))
        ]
        return np.argmax(samples)
    
    def update(self, variant, reward):
        if reward:
            self.successes[variant] += 1
        else:
            self.failures[variant] += 1
```

### Network Effects and Interference
**Considerations:**
- Social features may have spillover effects
- Marketplace experiments affect both sides
- Geographic clustering may be needed

## Best Practices

### Experimentation Culture
- Test everything testable
- Fail fast and learn
- Document all experiments
- Share learnings broadly
- Celebrate learning, not just wins

### Statistical Rigor
- Don't peek at results early
- Run tests to completion
- Correct for multiple comparisons
- Consider practical significance
- Account for seasonality

### Technical Excellence
- Ensure clean randomization
- Monitor for SRM
- Track all relevant metrics
- Build reusable components
- Maintain experiment registry

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Peeking Problem
**Problem:** Checking results repeatedly inflates false positive rate
**Mitigation:** Use sequential testing or wait for completion

### Pitfall 2: Underpowered Tests
**Problem:** Test ends without detecting real effects
**Mitigation:** Calculate required sample size, ensure sufficient traffic

### Pitfall 3: Selection Bias
**Problem:** Non-random assignment corrupts results
**Mitigation:** Use proper randomization, check for SRM

### Pitfall 4: Simpson's Paradox
**Problem:** Aggregate results hide segment-level effects
**Mitigation:** Always perform segment analysis

## Success Metrics

### Experimentation Program Metrics
- Experiments run per quarter
- Percentage of decisions test-driven
- Win rate (successful experiments)
- Velocity (time from idea to decision)
- Coverage (% of surfaces testable)

### Business Impact
- Cumulative lift from experiments
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings from avoided bad changes
- Learning value generated
- Risk mitigation
