description: Step-by-step process for performance
steps:
  - N+1 QUERIES — database calls inside loops, missing eager loading
  - UNNECESSARY COMPUTATION — work done on every request that could be cached or pre-computed
  - MISSING INDEXES — columns filtered, sorted, or joined without an index
  - LARGE PAYLOADS — over-fetching data, missing pagination, uncompressed responses
  - BLOCKING OPERATIONS — sync I/O in async contexts, long-running work on the main thread
  - MEMORY LEAKS — unbounded caches, event listeners not cleaned up, large objects held in scope
  - REDUNDANT NETWORK CALLS — missing batching, no request deduplication, no caching headers
  - ALGORITHMIC COMPLEXITY — O(n²) or worse where a better algorithm exists
  - **Check for session file:**
  - **If no session exists:**
  - **If session exists:**
  - **During work:**
  - **On mode switch:**
