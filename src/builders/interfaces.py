"""Protocol-based mixin interfaces for optional builder features.

This module defines Protocol-based interfaces that enable builders to
declare optional feature support without tight coupling. A builder that
implements the SupportsSkills protocol gains access to the build_skills
method, and the type system understands this relationship.

Using protocols instead of traditional mixins provides:
1. Structural subtyping - no need to explicitly inherit
2. Type safety without runtime overhead
3. Flexibility for third-party builder implementations
4. Clear intent about optional features
